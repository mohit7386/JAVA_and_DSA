//Exception Handling ->
/*What is an Exception?
An exception is an unexpected event that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of instructions.

Example: Dividing a number by zero, accessing an invalid array index, etc.

⚠️ Why do we need Exception Handling?
To prevent program crash during unexpected situations.

To handle errors gracefully.

To ensure the user gets proper messages instead of cryptic system errors.

To continue program execution even if something goes wrong.

✅ Step 1: Basic Structure of Exception Handling
In Java, we use these keywords:

try → Code that might cause an exception.

catch → Block that handles the exception.

finally → Always executes (whether exception occurred or not).

throw → Used to manually throw an exception.

throws → Declares exceptions a method might throw. */
