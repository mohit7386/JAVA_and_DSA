/*What is Hierarchical Inheritance?
When multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class, it is called Hierarchical Inheritance.

âœ… Real Life Example:
Let's say we have a University class, and from it, multiple departments like EngineeringDepartment and MedicalDepartment are derived.

//Multiple child class rely on the same parent that is exactly hierarchical Inheritance

//Driver Code
public class Inheritance6 {
    public static void main(String[] args){
        //creating objects for the child classes yahan hum dono ke alag alag objects create karemge because kyuki dono parent pe rely hain 
        EngineeringDepartment Obj1=new EngineeringDepartment();
        MedicalDepartment Obj2=new MedicalDepartment();
        //accessing Engineering department
        System.out.println("----Engineering Info----");
        Obj1.showuniName();
